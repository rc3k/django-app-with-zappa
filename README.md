# Django app with Zappa

A simple app that includes a minimal Restful API to handle application for a current account, with an admin interface for approving these applications, and an associated Celery task.

The only purpose of creating this, aside from my enjoyment of playing around with Django & Celery, was to test a deployment to AWS lambda using [Zappa|https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa]. It worked!
